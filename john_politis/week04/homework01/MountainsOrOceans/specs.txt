Mountains or Oceans

Create a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) app for either Mountains or Oceans (or anything else that you pick).

Make sure to include the following:

    A page that shows one record (e.g. one mountain)
    A way to create, update, and delete a record

Make sure to use:

    SQL
    Seperate your concerns (with views for each action)
    Use a layout to hold all of your generic code
