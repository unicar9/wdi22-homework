Games on Rails

Games on Rails is a web application with three games

    Magic 8 Ball
    Secret Number
    Rock Paper Scissors

Magic 8 Ball

    Magic 8 ball takes user's questions from the the URL as params and returns a positive or negative answer.
    You should make a route like /games/magic/:question which routes to magic#play (i.e. you will need a controller 
    called magic_controller.rb).

Secret Number

    Users click a number between 1 and 10. The controller validates the guess and renders the win or lose view.

    You should make a route like /games/secret/:guess which routes to secret#play 


Rock Paper Scissors
       
    Create a route that goes from /games/rock_paper_scissors/:throw to rps#play

    Use params[:throw] as a user's choice

    Compare the 2! If users throw matches the apps throw, the user wins.


    i.e. If a user throws rock http://localhost:3000/games/rock_paper_scissors/rock and the server picks rock player wins! 
    (Yes, I know that is not how RPS works) 

    
    Bonus: Set the win or lose condition based on the real rules of Rock Paper Scissors.
