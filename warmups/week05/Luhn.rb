# Counting from rightmost digit (which is the check digit) and moving left, double the value of every second digit. For any digits that thus become 10 or more, subtract 9 from the result.
#
# E.g., 1111 becomes 2121, while 8763 becomes 7733 (from 2Ã—6=12 â†’ 12-9=3 and 2Ã—8=16 â†’ 16-9=7).
#
# Add all these digits together. For example, if 1111 becomes 2121, then 2+1+2+1 is 6; and 8763 becomes 7733, so 7+7+3+3 is 20.
#
# If the total ends in 0 (put another way, if the total modulus 10 is 0), then the number is valid according to the Luhn formula; otherwise it is not valid. So, 1111 is not valid (as shown above, it comes out to 6), while 8763 is valid (as shown above, it comes out to 20).
#
# Write a program that, given a number, can check if it is valid per the Luhn formula.
#
# BONUS:
#
# For an invalid number, add a check digit to make the number valid.
